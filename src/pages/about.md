        I'm a Software developer from [Totoró](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totor%C3%B3), Colombia.
        I've lived in different cities in Colombia, and moved to Sweden two years ago.
            
    

        During school, I was a librarian assistant at the
        [Casa del Pueblo](https://www.lafm.com.co/colombia/premio-nacional-bibliotecas-fue-la-casa-del-pueblo-inza-cauca)
        public library,
        where I falled in love with reading books. As I enjoyed video games 👾 and technology, I decided
        to study Industrial Automation Engineering where I had the possibility
        to explore firmware programming, robotics and enterprise applications development.


        After University, I moved to Bogotá to work as a .NET developer,
        later moved to Cali and joined AlertLogic where I started with
        Erlang/Elixir and decided to focus on it. The idea of building highly available,
        fault-tolerant, distributed systems was exciting!
        Right now, I'm working in Stockholm, Sweden 🇸🇪, as 
        a backend developer using Elixir and Golang.


        In my spare time, I created a devotionals app that has more than 100.000
        downloads and more than 700.000 monthly visits.
        I've also started an [Open Source project](https://github.com/rwngallego/perfecty-push) 
        to send Push Notifications for free ⚡️, initially as a Wordpress plugin because its user base is huge, and
        "*customers don't care about your solution but their problems*", [[1]](https://blog.leanstack.com/the-artist-and-the-innovator/).
        Going straight to the building phase without first approaching your end users could not be the most optimal way of using your resources:

        *I hope we can have a chat soon! You can reach me on Slack or [Contact me](/contact)*.
    

        For the moment, below is a picture of the Casa del Pueblo public library:
