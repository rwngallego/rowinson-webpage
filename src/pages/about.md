      I'm a Software Developer from the small town [Totoró](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totor%C3%B3), Colombia (yeah, it [has a cool name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro)). Currently I'm working at Derivco Sweden AB, in Stockholm, as a Backend developer. I have experience with many different technologies both as a Backend or Frontend developer. I love Linux and have had a lot of fun with AWS.


      After graduating from University I started as a .NET Software developer in Bogotá, to later move to Cali to join Alert Logic as a Frontend developer where I met Erlang/Elixir and decided to focus on it. In Derivco, my current employer, I'm mostly working with Elixir and Golang. Right now I want to learn more about Domain Driven Design, Azure and Golang.


      In my free time I love coding, reading and running. I'm in charge of a free devotionals app that has more than 100.000 downloads and more than 300.000 monthly visits.
